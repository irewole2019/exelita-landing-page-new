This is placeholder text for DOCX content. To get accurate text extraction, please:
1. Convert your DOCX file to PDF format, or
2. Copy and paste the text content directly into a TXT file

The file was uploaded successfully, but DOCX text extraction requires additional dependencies that are not currently available.`
